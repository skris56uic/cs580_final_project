# Problem 6 (10 points)

**Task:** Run the 3-line join using the dataset of Problem 5 on MySQL.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Dataset Loading:** Load the dataset generated in Problem 5 into a MySQL database[cite: 56].
    * You will need to create tables corresponding to $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.
    * Insert the tuples generated in the "stress test" configuration from Problem 5.

2.  **Execution:** Run the 3-line join query on the database.

**Report Requirements:**
* **Verification:** Are the results the same as the other implementations? [cite: 57]
* **Performance:** What is the running time? [cite: 57]
* **Analysis:** Is the actual running time closer to the running time of the implementation from **Problem 2** (Yannakakis/Semijoin) or from **Problem 3** (Sequential/Left-Deep), and why? [cite: 58]
